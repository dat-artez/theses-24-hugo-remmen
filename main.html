        <div class="subtitle">HOW TO PIERCE THE WALL OF SOUND OF THE CULTURE INDUSTRY</div>

        <div class="header">NEW NOISE OF THE DIGITAL AGE</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            Noise did not exist until humans made machines. Surely, a forest during a windy day would produce something akin to what we know as white noise, but before industrialization, the negative connotation of noise could not have been the same. The sound of a waterfall or the wind rustling leaves is not disruptive nor unpleasant to the ear.
            <br>The Italian painter and composer Luigi Russolo wrote about this in his manifesto titled The Art of Noise in 1913. Futurist music, he said, should “conquer the infinite variety of noise-sounds.” The new noise of the Industrial Revolution introduced a variety of new sounds which composers of the time failed to encapsulate for their music, according to Russolo.
            <br>The radio introduced us to the noise of interference, a sound previously unknown, and a type of noise that carries with it not only the audible white noise of a radio in between channels, but also a new meaning: the disruption, or absence, of information. This inaudible noise was taken further when we were introduced to television - the static of a CRT screen shows us a visual representation of what a radio sounds like. An infinite variation of tiny snippets of information, each with some sort of meaning inside of them individually, amalgamating into a meaningless plane of chaos: noise.
            <br>If every major technological advancement in the field of media presents us with a new type of noise, what kind of noise has the digital age brought us?  With the coming of the internet, the digital age pulls us into this plane - the modern viewer does not see the noise from the outside, but actively participates in it. The infinite number of information points has become their natural environment.

        <div class="header">SOUND AS AN OBSTRUCTOR OF CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            As Salomé Voegelin writes in the introduction of her book Listening to Noise and Silence: “Sound’s ephemeral invisibility obstructs critical engagement, while the apparent stability of the image invites criticism.” Seeing, though more subjective than the mechanical Looking is distant. The Seen does not enter the body of the observer, nor does the observer enter the space of the Seen. Hearing, however, “does not offer a meta-position”. The listener is together with the sound responsible for what is heard. The Heard has to reach inside the body of the listener, and the listener has to be inside the space of the Heard. Hearing and listening objectively is therefore impossible because a listener cannot position themselves to hear an outside perspective. Changing perspectives can be done by a Looker but never by a Hearer.
            <br>In the internet age, mass media has changed form. Mass broadcast media like radio and television presented themselves as a two-dimensional plane, a projection screen. These forms of media did not allow their observer to interact with them or modify their content. With the coming of the internet, media became interactive, adding a third dimension. New media takes the shape of a volume. Although new media is visual in appearance, in reality the modern media space acts as a soundscape. It fills a space and indiscriminately makes its way into the ears of whoever is present. It is impossible to look away in the same way it is impossible to turn away from a sound. New media makes the viewer into its speaker (as both a person speaking and a sound source). The viewer curates their own experience by engaging with content that others make, who themselves are again consumers of this same content. In the same way, the listener is the creator of sound, because sound is only experienced once it reaches the ear and is heard. To consume new media is to simultaneously be part of it and be surrounded by it. To be able to hear a sound the listener has to be in its ‘sound-space’.
            <br>This figurative sound-space that is the new media space is consequently hard to critically engage with. The meta-position that a Looker can take does not exist for the Hearer. A medium that makes its user their own creator and curator is to a certain extent immune to criticism. If the user is displeased with something they see on the internet, it can be blamed on their own algorithm, which is in turn created by their own behaviour. Where the old Looker could look at their two-dimensional television screen and sneer at the quality of the programming, the modern Hearer of media submerges their head in the volume of their online environment and is unable to objectively experience any of it - let alone offer criticism - because there are parts of it that are behind their head, parts that they made themselves, parts that their friends inhabit, parts that are important to their career. They are as much creators of this environment as they are its audience.

        <br>
        <div class="header">THE CULTURE INDUSTRY AS NOISE</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            In their book Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term Culture Industry as the product of late capitalism commodifying popular culture to a point where it forms the consumers taste, creating a false sense of necessity for this entertainment. The worker needs to entertain themselves in order to cope with working the next day, in order to be able to entertain themselves. The form of this entertainment becomes homogeneous, because a divergence of the form would influence the demand negatively. The point of the Culture Industry is namely, like any industry, to maximize profits. Making ‘good culture’ is not a priority, because it does not make as much money as delivering on the expected form. The consumer of this culture is conditioned to expect homogeneity and is displeased by divergence of the standard form.
            <br>Inherent dynamics of capitalism dictate that the demand for labour grows, which in turn grows the demand for entertainment. These two forces compete for the attention of the worker, resulting in an increase of information density in entertainment. This is the birth of short form content, the infinite scroll, and the multiplication of screens. The modern entertainee – no longer satisfied by only one stream of images and sounds – has a living room screen, a pocket screen, a screen on their eyes, a screen on their fridge.
            <br>This necessity for entertainment is of course completely fabricated - entertainment seems to be a psychological need, and one could argue that ‘playing’ or ‘being entertained’ is necessary for a person to maintain their psychological health, but the objective of the Culture Industry not to satisfy these needs. Its objective is solely to maintain high demand for entertainment, which works by keeping people doing work they would normally not want to do. This false sense of necessity and its ties to mental wellbeing are further strengthened with the coming of new media and internet as mentioned in the previous paragraph, with entertainment becoming an environment in which social relations are maintained, and a sense of the digital self being strongly tied to online presence. With an increasing demand for entertainment, and a decreasing amount of free time, the dense and overlapping entertainment becomes noise: an overflow and in that an absence of information. While the Hearer tries to keep focus to be able to make sense of small snippets of information, the noise becomes impossible to follow – impossible to ‘actively listen’ to. Simultaneously, the Hearer cannot simply turn away, or choose not to listen, because the noise is part of their lives, and they are part of it.

        <div class="header">A DIFFERENT KIND OF LISTENING</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            As previously discussed, new media takes the form of a sound-space, so naturally, the words to describe engaging with new media should reflect this change. Previously, I have used the words ‘hearing’ and ‘listening’ somewhat interchangeably, but during and after this paragraph these two words will refer to different types of processing of auditory input as well as different ways to process visual stimuli.
            <br>Noise music demands a different kind of listening from other music and other non-noise media. It is important to acknowledge the use of the term listening is not completely accurate here, because not all noise music allows for listening but rather an experience that exists in a grey area between active interpretation of sound and the more passive experience of 'background noise'. A good example of this is the work of French noise artist VOMIR, specifically his Harsh Noise Wall pieces. These HNW pieces, as the term is frequently abbreviated, are roughly between 30 and 90 minutes long and consist of a thick wall of sound that is as static as it is erratic. The sound is so aggressive and chaotic that it forces the listener to be aware of its presence, while simultaneously being monotonous enough that there is no repeating or recognizable part for the listener to hold on to.
            <br>The music of VOMIR only allows for a type of experience that is not quite the active listening, because listening to detail is impossible, and not quite a passive experience of sound, namely hearing, because the sound is contextualized as music. Even if you would stumble upon this sound without this framework, it would be too assertive in its presence to phase into the background of your auditory perception. This grey area of experience is different from what the human brain is programmed to do, namely either interpreting every piece of information that we sense or choosing to ignore the barrage of data. The HNW simply does not have any information to interpret. There is nothing to understand or recognize about it, and this resistance to being understood is what makes listening to it a unique experience.
            <br>Learning to be comfortable with the space in-between understanding and ignoring can make it easier to create a more comfortable position between over-involvement and apathy in an age where media takes the form of the Harsh Noise Wall. This Wall of Noise that is new media, in the context of the Culture Industry, as Adorno and Horkheimer described, will be referred to as noise, in bold. Later on in this essay I will introduce noise, in italics, as its counterpart.
            <br>Trying to listen to the snippets of seemingly useful information in this barrage of content that the modern listener is being subjected to will cause over-involvement. The Hearer will grab onto some piece of information and try to follow it to its source, a process in which much more noise will present itself to them, try to identify with this piece and consequently get lost trying to string everything together. In reality, any particular piece of the noise is as meaningless as the amalgamation and consequential overflow of all these pieces. In this chase, the listener becomes part of the details of the Wall, part of the noise.
            <br>Alternatively, trying to only hear the noise will make the hearer apathetic, unaware of the larger movements within the Wall. The hearer stands outside the Wall. He can hear the wall and go: “Wow, yeah, that’s a pretty big wall of noise over there,” but he is unable to engage with it because he is not able to listen. The hearer chooses to ignore, and as soon as he chooses to listen, he sticks his head into the Wall and is no longer hearing.
            <br>There is, however, a third type of engaging with media. This type does not have a word, as it is something in between hearing and listening. It is synonymous with the way VOMIR’s Harsh Noise Wall forces an Earer (because using ‘listener’ or ‘hearer’ would be confusing here) to use their ears - not active listening and not passive hearing, but a space that could be described as meditative, where the Earer resists their mind trying to understand snippets of the noise, but also refrains from placing themselves outside of it apathetically. This place would allow for the Earer to observe the larger movements in the Wall without being over-involved by being pulled into smaller details, and without being apathetic, unable to relate to it in any meaningful way.

        <div class="header">DISRUPTIVE NOISE</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            Now that we know how we can critically listen to the noise of the Culture Industry in a space between apathy and over-involvement, we can start thinking of ways to disrupt this system. We have used the word noise to describe this overflow of information and entertainment. Noise as an oppressive system of sound - a space in which nothing else can be heard, because any sound will become part of the noise.
            <br>However, noise can be used to disrupt this system. This disruptive noise (from here on written in italics) is different from the oppressive noise in that it is able to break through the Wall. The difference between the bigger noise and the smaller noise is that the bigger noise is comprised of an amalgamation of seemingly infinite information points, which do have some sort of meaning individually, but come together so enormously that their individual meaning becomes just a point in the Wall of noise - indistinguishable from any other point, while still endlessly screaming for attention.
            <br>It is important to mention that this disruptive noise, and the Noisemaker later mentioned, is heavily influenced by the idea of the Destructive Character as described by Walter Benjamin, later expanded upon by Dick Raaijmakers in his book of the same name. The Noisemaker is not a maker, but a destroyer, a disruptor, but does so specifically by making noise.
            <br>On the following pages, I will make an attempt at a Noisemaker’s handbook. This is by no means a complete guide for effective Noisemaking, but an entry into the philosophy of the Noisemaker. Firstly, I do not know how, where and when exactly to effectively deliver pieces of noise to disrupt the system of noise, and secondly, a set of detailed instructions would negate the needed impulsivity and entropy for effective Noisemaking. Vagueness is necessary, because an excess of information would give the Noisemaker a clearer vision of a final result, which would in turn cause their noise to lose its noise-ness. The Noisemaker will know when their noise proves effective, because they will bear witness to its destructive power.

        <div class="header">DISRUPTIVE NOISE: THE NOISEMAKER MANIFESTO</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Disruptive noise, in contrast to systemic noise, is meaningless from the start. Its purpose is not to convey any particular message but the message of meaninglessness. This individual noise stands out as a hole in the Wall, because it is not trying to be understood. With enough holes, any Wall will eventually collapse.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise is contagious. It will pull nearby points of meaning into its own meaninglessness, expanding the hole. Its nihilism forces anyone watching to see that their chasing of information points is futile, and whatever they are throwing into the Wall will just become part of the noise, instead of reaching significance.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise creates unity in its alienation, while noise aims to create alienation in its unity. Noise coaxes mass consumers into following snippets of meaning to identify themselves with, creating a false sense of individuality that is picked from the Wall and therefore lacks individuality completely. The individual sees themselves as different from the rest of the individuals. Noise, however, alienates with its immediately apparent and blatant meaninglessness. It rejects the illusion of individuality and in that, creates unity in alienation.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise unlocks a different kind of listening. The Hearer of noise realizes that what they have been hearing is noise, and from that moment, will listen differently. Complete immunity to the manipulative nature of the Culture Industry will not happen from just one disruption, but noise will offer a way of resistance.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise is useless to the Culture Industry, because it is unsellable. It has no inherent meaning or identity; it has no discernible parts and therefore cannot be divided in portions; it cannot be subject to scarcity; it has no beginning and no end, no quantifiable time: more noise is not worth more money.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise is a maximum. When something reaches the threshold to become noise, there is no return to non-noise without starting from zero.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Therefore, noise is as additive as it is destructive. It is a destructor to systems that have been carefully constructed with and by meaning. Noise is able to destroy that meaning and collapse this system. The Wall of noise only requires one interruption to disrupt its monolithic nature, lose its wall-ness, and collapse.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	The Noisemaker must position themselves inside the Wall, become an Earer of the noise. Only by being aware of the movements in the Wall of noise, will the Noisemaker know where and when to strike.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	The Noisemaker must demand to be heard, and must do so by producing volume. Their noise must be loud enough to pierce the Wall. Producing amplitude in a three-dimensional volume means taking up space.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Like the Destructive Character, the Noisemaker must not try to be understood, because that would mean that there is meaning to their noise, which would turn it back into part of the noise. It is therefore imperative that the Noisemaker’s noise remains meaningless.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise must be impulsive. If the Noisemaker thinks too much about what sort of noise they will make, their noise will gain meaning - and the Noisemaker will become akin to a builder of things, a maker. Their noise will lose its destructive force - and more importantly, become part of the noise.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	Noise is meaningless, but not pointless. The point of noise is clear - to weaken the Wall and eventually destroy it - therefore the point of noise must be clear to the Noisemaker. They must know this point and refrain from pointless noise, because again, without a point, noise becomes noise.
            <br><br>▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓	When the Wall crumbles, the task of the Noisemaker is done. Without a system to disrupt, noise is not only meaningless, but pointless. When this time comes, the Noisemaker must stop making noise, and find something else to do.
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="header">IN CONCLUSION</div>
        <div class="main_text">
            In the digital age, the Culture Industry has taken on a new, more menacing form. Mass media is no longer made for the masses, a universal form to please as many people as possible, but heavily personalized to maximize engagement by algorithms that adapt to individual behaviour and preferences. This involved form of entertainment changes from a two-dimensional plane projection into a three-dimensional space more akin to a soundscape, in which consumers participate by moving around, actively listening and contributing to the media. 
            <br>The commodification of this new media space under the rule of the Culture Industry causes the need for infinite growth of this industry, but we are approaching the maximum information density with increasingly shorter form content and more screens. We are approaching the information density of noise. When our media approaches noise, there is no more need for meaning.
            <br>Noise, however, can be used as a tool to undermine this system of entertainment dependency. Noise music makes the listener position themselves in a space between active engagement and apathy, passive ‘hearing’. This space allows for a critical and close to impartial stance in an environment where it seems impossible not to follow little snippets of information in a desperate attempt to find something to hold on to or to identify with.
            <br>As well as listening differently, makers can disrupt the Culture Industry by assuming the role of the Noisemaker. The Culture Industry takes the form of a Harsh Noise Wall, which the modern consumer is pulled into, and will endlessly chase information snippets in a search for identity and belonging. The Noisemaker can use disruptive noise, a type of noise that is inherently meaningless, to pierce the Wall, and eventually make it crumble.
